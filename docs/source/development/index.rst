Developping arim
=================

This section describes the workflow used to develop arim and define several conventions.

In this document, *arim root directory* refers to the directory which contains amongst other the file ``setup.py`` and
the subdirectories ``docs``, ``tests`` and ``arim``. Unless otherwise stated, all paths are given relatively from
this top directory; example: ``docs/conf.py``, ``arim/__init__.py``.
